# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Escapace values the independent security research community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to [security@escapace.com](mailto:security@escapace.com) preferably with a proof of concept.

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly. 

Non-vulnerability related security issues such as new great new ideas for security features are welcome on GitHub Issues. 

## Security-Related Information

We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations for secure use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note that examples and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be sufficiently hardened for production use.
